                <p> AVC Group has been working with ADVOCATUS since 2010. Currently, the specialists of the
                    Law Firm are handling several legal cases of our company. One of the most recent cases, successfully
                    completed in October 2012, involved the recovery of damages from an organization that performed work
                    as
                    a
                    subcontractor. Our lawyers promptly carried out a large amount of work to collect evidence, over 300
                    pieces
                    of evidence of the damages. Since the arguability of our position in court was obvious for the
                    debtor,
                    the
                    latter came forward with an initiative to conclude a settlement agreement. According to the
                    settlement
                    agreement approved by the court, the defendant reimbursed not only the losses, but also legal
                    expenses.

                <p> Fortunately, our firm had to face a problem for the first time that forced us to seek help from
                    lawyers. The urgency of the case forced us to look for a law firm quickly. I consider that I was
                    just lucky, when my eyes stopped on the website of ADVOCATUS Law Company and other firms were not
                    interested. From the first minute (the first employee of ADVOCATUS Legal Company I met was Oksana
                    Shushpannikova) I could not help noticing a professional approach to work. It was a real pleasure
                    because there are a lot of people offering services but not many professionals. Further events have
                    reinforced the belief that the ADVOCATUS law firm is what we need. We were not mistaken. And thank
                    you
                    very much for being there.
